I chose to incorporate CSS elements and a form into my project. Using
CSS, I changed the font of my website, added some color and created a 
navigation/link bar to allow easy access between each page. For the form, 
I implemented this feature as a tool for users to add new posts into the blog. 
I created a new HTML page and linked this form to the database, so that every 
time a new post is submitted, it will actually be recorded into the sqlite file.
